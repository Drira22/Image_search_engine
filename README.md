# Image Search Engine

This project is a **Visual Search Engine** designed to find similar images based on an uploaded image. It utilizes deep learning and powerful search indexing to offer fast and accurate results. The core components include VGG16 for feature extraction, Elasticsearch for efficient indexing and searching, and Flask for the web interface. The project is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Architecture

### Key Components

1. **VGG16 Feature Extraction**
   - The VGG16 deep learning model is employed for extracting feature vectors from images. It is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned for the specific task of extracting meaningful features from images for similarity comparison.

2. **Elasticsearch**
   - Elasticsearch is used to index the extracted features from the images. It enables fast, scalable, and efficient searching by storing and querying the image feature vectors in a manner that allows for quick similarity searches.

3. **Flask Web Interface**
   - A simple yet effective frontend built using **Flask** that allows users to upload images for querying similar images. It interacts with the backend to process the queries and display results in a user-friendly manner.

4. **Docker**
   - Docker containers are used for packaging and deploying Elasticsearch and Kibana. This allows the application to be easily run and maintained across different environments with minimal setup.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Drira22/Image_search_engine.git
cd Image_search_engine
```

### 2. Install dependencies
Install the required Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run Elasticsearch and Kibana with Docker
To run the Elasticsearch and Kibana containers, execute the following command:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
This command will build and start the Docker containers for Elasticsearch and Kibana. Once the containers are up and running, you can access the Kibana interface at http://localhost:5601

### 3. Launch the App
After Elasticsearch and Kibana are running, you can start the Flask application:
```bash
python app.py
```

## ðŸ“„ Usage

To use the Visual Search Engine, click the "Upload Image" button on the web interface to select an image from your local machine. The search engine will then process the uploaded image using VGG16 feature extraction and Elasticsearch indexing to find similar images and display the results.
